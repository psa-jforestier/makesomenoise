AutoName: Make Some Noise
Summary: Push a button, or move your phone, to make some noise.
Description:
Simple fun app to play a sound when you touch a button, or when you whip your phone.

This app is 1st attempt to create an Android app, but it is quite fun to use. You can virtually
whip your find, or make fun of them. You can play the Dun Dun Duuun or Suspens sound when
someone is down during a murder party :-) . Did you see some The Big Bang Theory episode when
they whip each other or play a murder party ? The sounds are almose the same, and you can
use the app like they do it on the show.

The sounds cant be changed (it will come in a future version)
